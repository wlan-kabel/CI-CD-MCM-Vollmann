# Exercise 4: Vulnerability Scanning & Kubernetes Deployment

**Course:** Continuous Delivery in Agile Software Development (Master)
**Points:** 24

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline
- Scan Docker images and Go dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Deploy a multi-tier application to Kubernetes (Minikube)
- Understand Kubernetes concepts: Deployments, Services, Secrets, Probes

## Prerequisites

- Completed Exercise 3 (CI pipeline with quality gates)
- Docker Desktop installed
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) installed
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed
- [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/) installed (optional, for local scanning)

## What's New in This Exercise

- **Kubernetes manifests** (`k8s/`) -- Deployment, Service, Secret, PVC
- **Trivy scanning** -- container image vulnerability scanning
- **Dependency scanning** -- Go module vulnerability checks
- **Complete CD pipeline** -- from code to running in Kubernetes

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: Vulnerability Scanning -- Docker Image (6 Points)

1. **Build the Docker image locally:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t product-catalog:latest .
   ```

2. **Scan the image with Trivy:**
   ```bash
   trivy image product-catalog:latest
   ```

3. **Analyze the results:**
   - How many vulnerabilities were found? Categorize by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).
   - Which base image contributes the most vulnerabilities?
   - Can you reduce vulnerabilities by changing the base image? Try switching to `scratch` or `distroless`.

4. **Add a Trivy scan job to the CI pipeline** (see the TODO in `ci.yml`) that:
   - Runs after the `docker-build` job
   - Scans the built Docker image using `aquasecurity/trivy-action@master`
   - Fails the build if CRITICAL or HIGH vulnerabilities are found
   - Outputs results in `table` format

   > **Hint:** The Trivy action needs `image-ref`, `format`, `exit-code`, and `severity` parameters.

5. **Upload the Trivy scan results as a build artifact:**
   - Generate a JSON report (use `format: 'json'` and `output` parameter)
   - Upload it using `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
   - Use `if: always()` so the report is uploaded even if the scan finds vulnerabilities

**Deliverable:** Trivy scan output (before and after base image optimization). Updated CI workflow. Trivy JSON report downloadable as artifact from the Actions run.

---

### Task 2: Vulnerability Scanning -- Dependencies (4 Points)

1. **Scan Go dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Using govulncheck (official Go vulnerability checker)
   go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest
   govulncheck ./...
   ```

2. **Add a `vulnerability-scan` job to the CI pipeline** (see the TODO in `ci.yml`) that:
   - Runs after the `test` job
   - Installs `govulncheck` and runs it against the codebase
   - Fails if known vulnerabilities are found

   > **Hint:** Use `go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest` to install the tool.

3. **If vulnerabilities are found:**
   - Update the affected dependencies (`go get -u <module>`)
   - Document the CVEs and how you resolved them

**Deliverable:** govulncheck output. Updated `go.mod` if changes were needed.

### Task 3: Kubernetes Deployment with Minikube (8 Points)

1. **Start Minikube:**
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```

2. **Build the image inside Minikube's Docker daemon:**
   ```bash
   eval $(minikube docker-env)
   docker build -t product-catalog:latest .
   ```

3. **Deploy the application:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres-deployment.yml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/api-deployment.yml
   ```

4. **Verify the deployment:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get all -n product-catalog
   kubectl logs deployment/product-catalog-api -n product-catalog
   ```

5. **Access the API:**
   ```bash
   minikube service product-catalog-api -n product-catalog --url
   # Use the returned URL to test the API
   curl <URL>/health
   curl <URL>/products
   ```

6. **Test CRUD operations** against the Kubernetes-deployed API.

**Deliverable:** Screenshots of:
- `kubectl get all -n product-catalog` output
- Successful API calls to the Kubernetes-hosted service
- Pod logs showing healthy operation

---

### Task 4: Production Readiness (6 Points)

1. **Scaling:** Scale the API deployment to 3 replicas and verify all pods are running:
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment product-catalog-api --replicas=3 -n product-catalog
   kubectl get pods -n product-catalog
   ```

2. **Health Checks:** The Kubernetes manifests include `readinessProbe` and `livenessProbe`. Explain:
   - What is the difference between a readiness and a liveness probe?
   - What happens if the readiness probe fails? What about the liveness probe?
   - Why are different `initialDelaySeconds` values used?

3. **Resource Limits:** The API deployment specifies CPU and memory limits. Explain:
   - What happens if a pod exceeds its memory limit?
   - What happens if it exceeds its CPU limit?
   - Why are requests and limits both specified?

**Deliverable:** Add a `K8S.md` file with your answers and screenshots.
